## Specification 

Takes in input consisting of name, address, attendance weight scale (1-5). Plots the 
address of each row onto a localised map. Size of the dot reflects the attendance weight. 
Optionally, future improvements can be made to this script which differentiates between 
portfolios and divisions using different symbols.
