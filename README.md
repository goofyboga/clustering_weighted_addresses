## Specification 

Takes in user input consisting of name, address, attendance weight scale (1-5) and portfolio. Plots the 
address of each row onto a localised map. Size of the dot reflects the attendance weight. Optionally,
future improvements can be made to this script which differentiates between portfolios using 
different symbols.
